The Oxford-IIIT pet dataset is a 37 category pet image dataset with roughly 200
images for each class. The images have large variations in scale, pose and
lighting. All images have an associated ground truth annotation of breed.

Please take note of the following:
- Valid bounding boxes of the pets' heads are only provided for the training split. The test split does not contain annotations.
- A few image files in the original dataset are corrupt or in a wrong format. These are being skipped.
