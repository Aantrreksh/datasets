The Wake Vision dataset for person detection.

The dataset contains images with annotations of whether each image contains a person. Additional annotations about perceived gender, perceived age, subject distance, lighting conditions, depictions, and specific body parts are also available.

The dataset has been generated by relabelling Open Images v7. See the [Wake Vision Project Github Repository](https://github.com/Ekhao/Wake_Vision) for more information.

We publish the annotations of this dataset under a CC BY 4.0 license. All images in the dataset are from the Open Images v7 dataset, which sourced images from Flickr listed as having a CC BY 2.0 license.
